/**
 * The representation of a Course at Wake Tech.

 * <p>
 * The general concept of a course is that it has a roster of students. For each
 * of these students, there is a list of Assignmemts. This list of Assignments
 * may have multiple Assignments with identical names, as a student may attempt
 * an Assignment multiple times.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In addition to a roster of students with their assignments, a Course has a
 * String department name (such as "CSC" or "DBA") and an int course number
 * (such as 151 or 120).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The course roster is a Map&lt;Integer, List&lt;Assignment&gt;&gt;, where the
 * key is the student's id number.
