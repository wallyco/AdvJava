/**
 * Class containing static method to generate a Student object and add him or her to the
 * StudentBody.
 * <p>
 * Because we want the same student in multiple courses, the list of possible student ids is
 * limited and our random student id generator will generate duplicate student ids.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Because we want the student associated with a given id to have only one name, we
 * base the name on the generated id.  So, if student 111 is "Sophie Princess," everytime
 * the random number generates 111, that Student object will always be given 
 * the name "Sophie Princess."
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There will be lots and lots of student ids whose name is Sophie Princess, however.
